                <h4 class="fw-bold text-primary">1. Project Definition</h4>
                <p class="text-muted">The first step determines the goal of the website and what its design needs to accomplish. This involves collaboration with stakeholders like clients or agencies.</p>

                    <li><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-dot text-primary me-2"></i> Stakeholder meetings</li>
                    <li><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-dot text-primary me-2"></i> Product definition</li>

                </ul>
                <p>Every design process starts with the existence of a problem. Before designers develop a solution, they must <strong>understand the problem they are trying to solve and the objectives they want to achieve</strong>.</p>
                <p>For example, if you're contacted by an agency that wants you to redesign its website, you're already at the starting point. This means you're aware there's a problem with the current design that you need to resolve in the new design.</p>
                <p>This is mainly a research stage, where you <strong>conduct interviews, get to understand the user's needs, analyze the competition, and gather all the necessary data</strong>. The goal is to define the project by brainstorming the purpose of the product as well as clarifying its value proposition, how it solves users problems and what are competitive advantages.</p>

                    <li><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-dot text-primary me-2"></i> Who is the target audience?</li>
